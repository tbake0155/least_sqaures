Python was the selected programming language. The file "least_squares.py" contains the programming solution. A few output files are attached to show the output of the program.  Several files had to be provided since the output would not fit on the screen all at one time.

The solution is only in double precision.  Single precision in python is not natively supported, and although I do know a solution to get single precision floating point numbers, I had an incredibly difficult time understanding and completing the assignment ( and the homework), so I did not have time to implement that functionality.

Also, I was not able to implement the L-infinity norm to find the second error column for part b.  It seems like it should be trivialy easy, but I've confused myself into a stupor!  


I am not entirely confident in the results although I tried to follow the procedure outlined in the assignment as best as I could.
